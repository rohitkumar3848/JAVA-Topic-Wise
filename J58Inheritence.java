/*Inheritence-->It is a process by whicch the derived class can acess the properties of 
base class by using extends Keyword.
It provides code reusability.
We can't acess private member of class through inheritence.
Method Overriding only possible through inheritence.
Types Of Inheritence--->
1.Simple Inheritence-->In this one super class and one sub class.
1.Mullevel Inheritence-->In this one super class and multiple sub class.
1.Hieirarchical Inheritence-->In this one super class and multiple sub class and all sub class
directly extends super class called Heirarchical Inheritence.
Multiple Inheritence-->When a sub class wants to extends two or more super clases that have same 
method the java Compiler get confuse which method should invoke.
Then their might be a chance of memory duplication that's the reason the java doesn't support 
the multiple inheritence.
