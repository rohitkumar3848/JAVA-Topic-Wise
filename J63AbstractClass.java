/*Abstract Class--->1.A class which contain abstract in its declarations.
2.We can't create object for it.
3.We can create of reference of abstract class using derived class.
4.It may or may not contain abstract methods.
5.It can have non abstract methods(static final etc..).
6.To use abstract class we have to inherit it with sub class.
7.If a class contain partial implementation then we should declare a class as abstract.
Example If there is any abstract method inside it then the class should be abstract.


Abstract Methods-->The method have acess modifier abstract called as abstract method.
-->It can used in abstract class only.
-->It doesn't contain any body of the method.
-->Abstract method must be overriden in sub clases otherwise it will also a became abstract class.
-->Whenever the action is common but implementation is different the we should use abstract mehod.
