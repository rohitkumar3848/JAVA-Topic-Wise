/*Constructor-->It is a special method which has same name as class name and invoked automatically when
the object of class is invoked.
Every java class has a constructor.
It's main purpose of constructor is intialise the object.
It doesn't contain return type include void.
Its types-->
1.Default constructor-->which doesn't have any parameter.(If doesn't make any default constructor then
java compiler automatically invoked by defaultly default constructor).
2.Parametrized constructor-->A constructor through which we can pass one or more parameter.
3.Copy Constructor-->Whenever we pass object reference to constructor.(Copy data of another constructor
by passing copy as a reference in the parameter of constructor).
4.Private Constructor-->It is possible in java to write a constructor as aprivate but accrording to the
rule we can't acees private members outside the class.

    compiler get confuse when both constructor are declared or defined.
