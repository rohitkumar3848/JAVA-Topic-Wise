/*
Super Keyword--> 1.It refers to the current object inside a method or constructor.
2.When the local and instance variable name are same then JVM get confuse which one is local or instance
variable to avoid this problem we use this keyowrd for refering the variable.
3.It is also used when we want to call the default constructor if its own class.
Note-->
1.Whenever the supclass and super class variable and method name both are same the it can be used only.
2.To avoid the confusion between super class and sub class variables and methods that have same name
we should use super keyword.
3.It is used with -->Variable-->method-->constructor.
